# eco-audit

Creating a complete Python program for an "eco-audit" tool involves several components such as data handling, integration with IoT devices, and providing actionable insights. Below is a simplified version of such a tool. This version does not connect to actual IoT devices but uses simulated data for demonstration purposes.

```python
import random

class CarbonFootprintTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initial data structure to store different sources of emission
        self.emission_sources = {
            'electricity': 0,  # in kWh
            'water': 0,        # in liters
            'gas': 0,          # in liters
            'transport': 0     # in km
        }

    def simulate_iot_reading(self):
        # Simulated IoT readings for energy and resource usage
        try:
            self.emission_sources['electricity'] += random.uniform(0.5, 2.0)  # kWh
            self.emission_sources['water'] += random.uniform(50, 200)         # Liters
            self.emission_sources['gas'] += random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)          # Liters
            self.emission_sources['transport'] += random.uniform(0, 50)       # Km
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during IoT data simulation: {e}")

    def calculate_carbon_footprint(self):
        # Calculate carbon footprint based on the stored data
        try:
            carbon_footprint = (
                self.emission_sources['electricity'] * 0.233 +  # kg CO2/kWh
                self.emission_sources['water'] * 0.0016 +       # kg CO2/liter
                self.emission_sources['gas'] * 2.31 +           # kg CO2/liter
                self.emission_sources['transport'] * 0.21       # kg CO2/km
            )
            return carbon_footprint
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during carbon footprint calculation: {e}")
            return None

    def provide_insights(self):
        # Provide actionable insights based on current data
        try:
            insights = []
            if self.emission_sources['electricity'] > 10:
                insights.append('Consider using energy-efficient lighting and appliances.')
            if self.emission_sources['water'] > 1000:
                insights.append('Check for leaks or consider water-saving fixtures.')
            if self.emission_sources['gas'] > 10:
                insights.append('Explore alternatives like electric heating.')
            if self.emission_sources['transport'] > 100:
                insights.append('Try to carpool or use public transportation more often.')

            return insights if insights else ["Your usage is well within sustainable limits!"]
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error generating insights: {e}")
            return ["Error providing insights."]

def main():
    tracker = CarbonFootprintTracker()

    # Simulate daily or periodic input from IoT devices
    try:
        for _ in range(30):  # Simulating data for 30 days
            tracker.simulate_iot_reading()

        total_carbon_footprint = tracker.calculate_carbon_footprint()
        if total_carbon_footprint is not None:
            print(f"Total Carbon Footprint for the period: {total_carbon_footprint:.2f} kg CO2")

            insights = tracker.provide_insights()
            print("Actionable Insights:")
            for insight in insights:
                print(f"- {insight}")
        else:
            print("Failed to calculate carbon footprint.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in main process: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

### Program Explanation
- **Data Structure**: The program maintains a dictionary `emission_sources` to track different types of emissions.
- **Simulated IoT Readings**: The `simulate_iot_reading()` method simulates energy and resource consumptions.
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation**: Uses conversion factors to turn usage data into estimated carbon emissions.
- **Insights Generation**: Provides advice based on the level of usage to help reduce footprints.
- **Error Handling**: Implements try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully.

This code lays the foundation for an eco-audit tool and can be further expanded with features such as database integration, real IoT device data collection, and more detailed insights.
